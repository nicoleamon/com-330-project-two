  <h1>My Starting Line</h1>
  <h2>When Did I Start Running?</h2>
  <p>
    I started to run in since 6th grade. I ran cross country because I wanted to be athlete. Two weeks in and it was complete and
    utter torture. I started fantasizing about tying up my coach to a pole so that we wouldn’t have to run 3 miles every practice.
    Then one day to add to the nightmare… I fell in poop. We were doing hill-training and he really wanted us to utilize gravity
    and lean into our run on the way down. After that, I stopped running cross-country.

    Later, I continued to run in track and field where I could bare the practice, but my heart wasn’t really in it at this age.

<h2>My Progression</h2>
  <p>
    In high school, I picked up running again because of stress. It was way to get away
    from school and de-stress. I ran leisurely and really started to enjoy it.
