      <h2>When Did I Start Running?</h2>
      <p>
        I started to run in 6th grade. I ran cross country because I wanted to be athlete. Two weeks in and it was complete and
        utter torture. I started fantasizing about tying up my coach to a pole so that we wouldn’t have to run 3 miles every practice.
        Then one day to add to the nightmare… I fell in goose poop. We were doing hill-training and he really wanted us to utilize gravity
        and lean into our run on the way down. After that, I stopped running cross-country.

        Later, I continued to run in track and field where I could bare the practice, but my heart wasn’t really in it at this age.

        In high school, I picked up running again because of stress. It was way to get away
        from school and de-stress. I ran leisurely and really started to enjoy it.

        In college, I started signing up for fun races like The Color Run, other 5k's, and The Hot Chocolate 15k.
        I was having so much fun doing these races with my friends and challenging myself by running faster and
        longer. I even started to running training to get better. At this point in my running journey, I really
        wanted to get better and I was excited to cross the starting line of every race.

        After running fun races like the Hot Chocolate 15k, I decided to run a half marathon.
        I wanted to make a goal for myself and really push myself farther. It was a scary process and I was
        always worried about getting injured or not finishing. I trained with my best friend, Riya, and she
        kept pushing to do better. In the end, I finished in 2 hours and 19 minutes. It was the fastest I had
        ever run and I felt great. I was so happy to finish without injuries and do better than I thought I would.
